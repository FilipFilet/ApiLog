# Description of ApiLog
ApiLog is a project i am developing, out of curiousity and the will to deepen my understanding of certain backend topics. It started out as a simple ASP.NET API, where i wanted to add some logging functionality. Thats the state of it at the moment, with some missing tweaks and additions. As wto what the API can to is, that it has some CRUD operations that revolves around managing organizations, such as creating and deleting an organization, while also able to add employees (managers and regular employees) to an organization. This isnt the main focus though. The main focus started out as the logging, but i also want to implement SignalR for two way communication, and perhaps other stuff in the future as to what makes sense.
